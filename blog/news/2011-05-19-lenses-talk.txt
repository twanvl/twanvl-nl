Two days ago I gave a talk on lenses at the Radboud Unviersity (where I work on my PhD on machine learning).
I put the slides online for your enjoyment, although it might be hard to follow, since it is light on explanatory text.

This talk includes information from at least <a href="/blog/haskell/overloading-functional-references">three different</a> <a href="/blog/haskell/References-Arrows-and-Categories">earlier</a> <a href="/blog/haskell/cps-functional-references">blog posts</a>, as well as <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.2841">Russel O'Connor's recent paper on multiplate</a>. There is no new information in the talk, but I do have a new favorite representation for lenses.
